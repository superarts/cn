按：这个笑话几乎根本就没法翻译，不知道我当年拿来的狗胆挑战这种高难度的事情，而且还可耻地失败了。后一个笑话翻译的也很差，不过类似的英语在“急冻侠”中出现过（马赛克脸亚洲人的“You are many good”）。

# 笑话一则

Xiao Wang finished his English exam and came out. His friend asked him how did he do his exam, for that he replied: "Exam was okay, but for the past tense of THINK, I thought and thought... and at last I wrote THUNK!"

大意：

- 小王考完英语后，他的朋友问他：“你考得怎么样？”
- “还行，”小王回答到，“但是关于‘THINK’的过去式，I thought and thought... 最后我写了‘THUNK’!”

从文中看，小王的口语还可以，但是他的脑子似乎……（笑）

## 外一则

```
One Japanese was enjoying the sun at the beach in America.
A lady came and asked him, " Are you relaxing? "
The Japanese answered, " No, I am Honta Japanese. "
Another guy came and asked the him the same question.
The Japanese answered, "No, No, Me Honda Japanese! "
Third one came and asked him the same question again.
The Japanese was totally annoyed and decided to shift his place.
While walking he saw another Japanese soaking in the sun.
He went up to him and asked,  "Are you Relaxing? "
The other Japanese was a lot more educated and answered, "Yes, I am relaxing. "
The first Japanese slapped him on his face and said, "Stupid, idiot. Everyone is looking for you  and your are sitting over here!"

一个日本人去美国旅游。

有一天，他正在海滩上享受日光浴，一位女士问他：“你是很轻松吗？”（Are you relaxing? 海滩常用语）

他回答道：“不，我是日本人本田。”

一会儿，一个男人走了过来，问了他同样的问题。

他回答道：“不，不！我是日本人本田！”

第三个人这么问他的时候，日本人急了。他准备换个地方。他走着走着，突然看到另一个做日光浴的日本人。于是他走过去问道：“你是很轻松吗？”

这个日本人显然受到过更好的教育。他回答道：“是的，我是很轻松啊。”

第一个日本人给了他一个嘴巴，骂道：“蠢货，混蛋！每个人走在找你，可你却躲在这儿！”
