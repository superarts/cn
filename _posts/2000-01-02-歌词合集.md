按：写作时间不可考的特别糟糕的歌词，我就都放在这里了。写作、录制时间大概是在2002年左右，当时用Windows平台，一开始用的是GoldWave然后用GoldWave，后来换成了CoolEdit，也就是现在被Adobe收购之后的Audition。注意SoundBooth是个简称SB的删减版。

# When Maths Strikes （数学来袭）

我为这首歌制作了3D MV。时间应该在2002年左右，当时学了一点3DS MAX的皮毛。

# Liberi Fatali （命运之子）

FF8片头曲。跟烂大街的Eyes on Me相比，拉丁文显然更有范儿。

# Rapper Meets Undead

使用War3人物语音混音制作，效果非常差。其实更值得一提的是，当时我用MPQ Extractor把所有语音和音轨解压了出来，然后把全任务过场语音加上背景音乐烧成CD（当时还没有MP3播放器）用来练习英语。所以现在很多剧情对话我都能背出来，包括Arthas对Illidan那段……You'll regret approaching me.

# No Mercy, Another Dimension, The Fool

完全忘了为什么写的这些歌词了。

# Intentment

天津话版名侦探柯南附带的歌。节奏感非常糟糕。

# Orc Ballad

这首歌也有3D MV，其中导出了魔兽3里兵营和Grunt的模型。

# 紫药丸系列, Remember Me

当时是Eminem脑残粉，所以翻译/翻唱了一些他的歌。因为阅历所限，很多东西都是错的。

# When Maths Strikes (Warcraft III Credit Theme)

```
There ain't no where to hide
there ain't no one can save your life
you have no wing you can't fly
when mathematic strikes

throw you hands hentai up real high
light you eL while gettin' high
hot shits that you can't deny
that's mathematical strike

cayley-hamilton say that's right
cramer's rule lights the light
laplace expands without cry
lagrange only standing by

cauchy never tells a lie
newton shows no chance to fly
all the fans of gauss inside
prepare mathematical strike

find out the matrix you can hide
orthogonalizaion is your life
your jordan form can make you fly
when mathematic strikes

throw you hands hentai up real high
light you eL while gettin' high
hot shits that you can't deny
that's mathematical strike
```

# Rapper Meets Undead

```
(Demonic Voice Intro)
Human, tremble before the scourge!

oh man it seems that the thing's gone too bad

							now you know undead always stands cool
who's the hot shit that's the most motherfuckin' cool	they say
	- My life for Ner'zul!
							you see undead must have a strong nerve
and what's your interest that you're always gonna do	cause they have a very big boss to serve
	- I wish only to serve! 
						yall the reign of chaos shall write a new chapter
						but how you become a professional pc gamer?
now what's your motto from the acient talker
	- Thy bidding, Master? 
						all you need is fortune, control and skill
what's your gonna saying to show how you feel	and all you need to do is clash and kill
	- Where shall my blood be spilled? 

you're so cool a motherfucker that ya better go to hell
	- I bow to your will. 

would you think the motherfuckin undead could write a new chapter
	- Yes, Master! 

to do that there is still a fuckin long way to journey
	- I gladly obey. 

some people may think that the undead is only lotta cells
	- My fate is sealed. 

but we know that you fuckin undead race is all for one
	- Thy will be done! 

in the whole entire warcraft world that's just reign of chaos
	- Death shall reign! 

there're just raper, killer, crusher and bone collecter
	- Fear the Reaper! 

hot shit your will be finally die in eternal peace?
	- Let life cease! 

(say) thanx, man. you should have your own way, see you later alligator, heh heh

Argh..

so that's the story when rapper meets undead
i hope the whole entire thing didn't make you sad
who you think is stronger, rapper or undead?
it's too mean you know the only way is to be bad
staying alive, you know only the stronger survive
holding your nerve, undead also shit be nine to five
you know it's cool to say your life is for ner'zul
when a rapper meets undead you'll feel a moody mood

(say)
woo, man! what a fucking crazy pretty laby! hey is that so called banshee?
i know her favorite is cursing, fucking magic and proceeding...
so ms banshee, say something please!

	- Let my cries chill the living!

	- What must I do? 
spread your legs lady ya got my dick you know i'm not a nine-to-five

	- Hi...

# No Mercy

```
11111	oh girl in my dream
11111	your heart is my beloved prison
111	baby c'mon
111111	my heart blossoms in crimson
11111	oh girl so pretty
11111	why you won't just let me be
1111	let me be me
1111111	only let me see you have no mercy
111111	you drive me crazy
111111	you have no mercy
111111	you're a fantasy
111	let me be


11	let me be
11	let me see
11	let me be me
111111	let me be me girl let me see
11	heavenly
11	patiently
11	faithfully
111111	i know you love me with no mercy
```

# Intentment

```
(intro)
THE INTENTMENT OF LIFE IS ONLY ONE!

well i know that's as stupid as a fuck (hah)
but i really want all of you hear this song...
yall!

tell you my friend it means nothing how many books you've read
cuz the only thing you need to do is follow your own footstep
it means a motherfucking nonsense how many songs you've heard
cuz the whole entire world for you is just a piece of boring shit
the very key for life is don't give a fuck to think too much
or you'll sense the dread of the unexpectable future or what
it would be better that wandering nowhere like a fucking blind
don't even care about what the motherfucking people talk about

it's not a knife all my fucking life is on the edge of life
why you think it's bad like a groggy stub? don't think about it!
you'll understand me when you step on the cliff of life
and the intentment of life will be discovered while i say "let us jump"

看过再多的书也没有用
一个人的路要他自己去走
听过再多的歌也觉得不对劲
为什么没有什么东西适合我
人生的关键就是不要想得太多
否则就会产生对未来的恐惧
盲目地到处漫步反而更好
别管别人会怎么他妈的议论

我的人生就是站在人生边上
摇摇晃晃又有什么不好呢？
走上悬崖你就会了解我的感受
一起跳吧，没问题！

# Another Dimension

```

Sometimes I...
Just feel like...

I Don't Wanna Giva Fuck!

holy shit, isn't there any motherfucker turn the radio on?

c'mon bitches I just don't wanna give a fuck
for you boy girls who just really suck
you abnormal mutants make me throw up
you don't wanna listen you can suck my cock
i don't own you pop guys a motherfucking
you don't like my style you can leave me alone
but let me tell you cock players you know nothing
all you motherfuckers got used to do is imitating

tell you motherfucker to blame that's my duty
i'm Mr. Don't Give A Fuck but not Mr. Friendly
you can suck my motherfucking dick if you don't like my shit
but know that that's a question to be or not to be
you said i should play better and rap faster
well i'm a new comer but i don't wanna be a nigga
i'll show you my hot shit so let me see you ma'ma
life is a drama for all the bitchers and motherfucker
```

# Orc Ballad

- Written by Dr. Doom
- Composed by Namco
- Performanced by Super Art Studio

```
Record: Super Art Studio

(Intro: Big Boy)

yall
this is big boy huh	Super Art	Dr. Doom
yall
oh fuck it... heh heh...

(Phase 1: Leo)

i know a game that's warcraft
i know a man he's room-cure
he did music about undead
also human and night elf

i wonder why there 	ain't no orc?
maybe he thought 	they are bad?
or he's jealousy 	in the fact?
cuz the orcs they 	have big cock? (ha-ha!)

forgive me playa' it's 	just for fun
i didn't mean to 	tease anyone
tauran chieftain 	he can stun
stomp on my music as hard as he can!

fuck it blademaster 	his a nut
the mirror is as stupid 	as a fuck
only suckers 	use wind walk
bladestorm rules but it's too hard...

there also goes a 	farseener
his wolf is weaker 	than water
it costs too high to 	use far sight
earthquake cannot hurt a geezer!

our motto is 	we are free!
archimond motherfucker his 	s.o.b!
the demons have no 	hold on me -
oh illdian ya got lunacy?!

well friends i don't do pop music
well friends i don't do rap music
well friends i just do fuck music
hah hah.. i'm just playing you orc, you know i love you -	room-cure	blizzard

c'mon big boy, feat with me!

(Phase 2: Big Boy)

ok. hmm...

so you like human's bitches and white coat?
and everywhere is night elf's ancient of war?
and undead's "double aura" rules after all?
and having chosen orc for you is a fault?!

fuck you stupid idiot you know nothing at all!
the orc is the strongest race o' the whole world!
on the brutal war! for the super art horde!
tell you motherfucking suckers you shall fall!

human alliance, you ain't gonna feel my shit
i know where you are for the sake of sentry stick
you ain't hear my voice, for we'll never meet
until i get hi upkeep and drown you with my piss!

night elves, you can show me your micro operation
your demon hunter does have a wise manipulation
those beautiful roes can play a		good commotion
but at last my tauran and shaman will give you an education

(whisper: ) don't you know ner'zhul himself is used to be an orc warlock
so will you undead piss yourself when you face your formal master? (hah - ha! )
we can: stomp your dog and we can purse your bird
we can shoot 'em down and fuck your corpse eater :)

so i just do fuck music
so i just do suck music
so i just do rush music
for you beloved motherfucker, ha!
```

# The Fool

```
The sun still rises and the sunshine still kisses my freaky ass
When I get up I check up if my dick still gets up like the good old days
yes I still have a hard cock I still have a mother freaky smart ass
and my life is still like one big bad Eminem said ball of sheet

have you got some freaky idea about the freaky mysterious tarot card?
they call me "the fool" due to my mother freaky always-be-inturned character
i'm always alone, i am never fair, i'm Mr. Don't give a fuck
however, now i'm considering how to give a fuck about the windows movie maker

microsoft is a good company in spite of it's a little bit self-conceit
"how about its monopolization? " ...fuck it! i'm not any American
because i saw too much this kind of sheet i think that would be fair
whatever monopolization, corruption, bribery, contraband and bootleg! (ha-ha)

i'm a fool, i know nothing about nowadays music and computer tech
i can't compose at all, i just write and rap the lyric as an idiot!
i use cooledit, and downloaded Steve Fazio's jazz style loop music
"Not for copy or discription"? hah hah, i also got that word on an porn picture!

my music is rubbish, my lyric shoots shit, my MTV is for fool only
i use your suggested windows movie maker just as a compressor maybe
i send that shit to you just to get that souvenir you promised to me
so if you don't give my award i will sue you as it's a dirty cheat!

"mother freaky bitch cry wild and loud! time's up bitch, hold your ass! "
i like this kind of shit although my collage english test mark is just fifty-six
my lyric contains no "blood, cut, guns, shot, nut, suck, rush, fuck"
if your english is poor just try "8 mile" and play blizzard's warcraft

so fuck yall!


The sun still rises and the sunshine still kisses my freaky ass
When I get up I check up if my dick still gets up like the good old days
"die motherfucker die time's up bitch, hold your ass! "
i like this kind of shit although my CET mark is just fifty-six

microsoft is a good company in spite of it's a little bit self-conceit
"how about its monopolization? " ...fuck it! i'm not any American
i send this shit to you just to get that souvenir you promised me
so if you don't give my award i will sue you as it's a dirty cheat!

Emm...

[Chorus: Super Art]
I take a couple uppers

But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's counting
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills

[Verse 1: Big Boy]

Cool, calm, just like your mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like motherfucker MZD
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than motherfucker Em tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
(Lip-Shooting)
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
super art throws the bomb and is dashing town
Doomer, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she (crashes) out

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2: Dr. Doom]
super art
90 of us
big boy brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Som, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something

[Verse 2: Leo]
tell you my friend it means nothing
how many books you've ever read
cuz the only thing you need to do

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Doomer]
I'm at rave
Lookin like slave a High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smelt like vomit
Pussy poppin', acid droppin', dope heavy guy
Heroine, mescaline, pencil leads - wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Doomer actin' ill
Drugs kill (Yeah, right)
Bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Doomer nut

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

[Song: Leo]

I take a couple uppers

But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
they want me censor my shit
they want me censor my shit
they fucking censor my shit
they censor my shit like this:

"I've been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

我开车过了六人就撞倒五个
Ah shit
我再来一个 a mosh pit
压扁一个 bitch
践踏那些被领养的孩子
这些 shrooms 让我发生幻觉
我出汗的时候体重就开始下跌
直到我看见那些 dumb shit start happening
dumber then motherfucker Em 试着 rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce

我说 c'mon bounce
屋子里的所有人都来一 ounce

Scary ass it was a false alarm
Think I'm about to die when I just got on

我见过所有模样
但它们都比不上 blue and yellow purple hills
我登过最高的山
一次或五次三番
但它们都比不上 blue and yellow purple hills

[Intro: Dirty Dozen]
(spin)
Emm...
yall, yall yall yall

[Chorus: Super Art]

我试过镇静药丸
我喝过咳嗽药水
但它们都比不上蓝色黄色紫药丸
我去过毒蘑菇山
一次或五次三番
但它们都比不上蓝色黄色紫药丸

[Verse 1: Big Boy]

酷，靓，像你妈妈一样
还有那些安定药片在她的手中央
这是恶作剧先生袖子上的游戏
在你周围升起就像他妈的MZD
我也说不好自己感觉如何
我开车过了六个人就撞了五个
啊，妈的
我卖掉我的车子
压扁一个婊子，践踏那些被领养的孩子！
这些毒蘑菇让我产生幻觉
我出汗的时候体重就开始下跌
我开始看见傻屄不停地唱Rap
比他妈的傻屄周杰伦还让人迷糊！
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
(Minigun-Shooting)
我说 c'mon bounce
屋里的所有人都应该来上一盎司
抽烟、可卡因都他妈是弱智！
我没废话你可以问上一问
超级艺术扔出炸弹在城里飞奔
Doomer，你妈妈刚刚从这里开过
赶快踢你妈的屁股省得她一会儿出车祸！

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2: Dr. Doom]
超级艺术
九十年代
big boy brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Som, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something

[Verse 2: Leo]
tell you my friend it means nothing
how many books you've ever read
cuz the only thing you need to do
is follow your own footstep
it means a motherfucking nonsense
how many songs you've ever heard
cuz the whole entire world for you
is just a piece of boring shit
the very key for life (is)
is don't give a fuck to think too much
or you'll sense the very dread
of the unexpectable future or what
it would be better that wandering nowhere like a fucking blind
don't even care about what the motherfucking people talk about - yall

[Verse 2: Boy n' Dr. Doom]
操他妈，谁去帮帮忙？
他在楼上赤身裸体拿着一杆枪
（嘿，Dan，你让我去上他的床？）
这就是迷幻药傻屄都遭了殃
（我翻遍了他们的所有钱箱
  就像胳膊不是自己的一样）
这就是爽！
年轻，傻屄，一无所长
我看他要把自己的舌头吞个精光！
（吓人的屁眼儿那个只是假象
  我怎么会去死我现在这么爽？）
别犯傻了，你这么High
我看你要和哪个傻屄一起醒来
我觉得我太过火
现实就等于堕落
红药，蓝药，和绿药
大药丸（Black Pill）
三甲氧苯乙胺！

[Verse 3: Doomer]
我他妈的不爽
简直像奴隶一样
曹开镛也不管用
身子闻着像臭虫
骚屄乱蹦，迷药乱扔，围着麻醉药打转
海洛因，酶丝卡琳，摇头丸——试试看？
蓝药丸，金封印
让我Doomer要玩儿完
戒毒（Yeah，Right）
婊子我说真的！
别你妈废话你个小骚货
你知道你的屁眼要什么
塞进你的傻屄
Dommer就这么弱！
[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

So what the fuck motherfucker? you think I'm damned motherfucker?

the only thing cheaper than a sucker is the motherfuckers does pop music
they repeat the same behavior day and day after they tread with each other
SO WHAT THE FUCK UP!?! these foul shits makes me sick and poison me over six minutes
til' I got two machinegunz in my hands, and one more revolver right upon my penis
so let me fire it up (handgun shot) and blow you up (shotgun reload)
and shot your motherfucking head off (shotgun fire)
I'll crush your ass (minigun fire) n' drill your cunt (drill)

Hey Von
You see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It's gotta be acid cuz the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cumm
And I think he bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
Think I'm about to die when I just got on
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit
I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (black pill)
Mescaline

Remember me? (Vecos)
Remember me? (Vinosec)
Remember me? (Maths attacks again!)
Remember me? (Everyone goes insane!)
